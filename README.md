How to run

Install streamlit if you don't have it:
pip install streamlit

Save the code below into a file, e.g. cgpa_app.py.

Run it:
streamlit run cgpa_app.py

The first run will create subjects.json in the same directory with example subjects & credits; edit that file if you want different subjects/credits.
